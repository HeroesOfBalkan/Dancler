# Getting Started

Before doing anything, make sure you understand the [Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md)

Now, create a new branch with:

```sh
git branch my-new-contribution-by-epic-me
```

Then switch to newly created branch with:

```sh
git checkout my-new-contribution-by-epic-me
```

# Making changes

# Documenting

After making changes you want and commiting everything, it's time to write down changes done in each commit.

Create one file in `./changelogs` named like this: `CHANGELOG-VER-{Version}-BY-{YourGitHubUsername}.md` and its content should be similar to [EXAMPLE-CHANGELOG.md](./changelogs/EXAMPLE-CHANGELOG.md), modified to your work, of course.

After writing the changelog, create a new commit `Documenting changes` and nothing else is needed.

Now, it's ready to push!
